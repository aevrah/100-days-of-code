# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 01, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Worked a little on the Udacity front-end nanodegree. Started Cassidy William's Udemy course ['JavaScript and React for Developers: Master the Essentials'](https://www.udemy.com/js-and-react-for-devs)

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to try out React. I've worked with Angular before, and I'd like to find out which framework I enjoy more.

### Day 2: January 02, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Started the website optimization project for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. Worked through most of the events and callbacks section of Cassidy William's Udemy course ['JavaScript and React for Developers: Master the Essentials'](https://www.udemy.com/js-and-react-for-devs). I didn't have enough time to get to the section project. 

**Thoughts:** Wish I had more time to spend on it today. I was taking notes on some of the examples given in the Udemy course, so it took a lot longer. 

### Day 3: January 03, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Finished the assignment from the events and callbacks section of Cassidy William's Udemy course ['JavaScript and React for Developers: Master the Essentials'](https://www.udemy.com/js-and-react-for-devs), which finished out the section. You can find my answer [here](https://github.com/aevrah/theme-toggler). I started the AJAX section. 

**Thoughts:** Already over 20% complete with the course. I think that it is well put together so far. The only issue I've had is with the volume. 

### Day 4: January 04, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Finished the AJAX section of Cassidy William's Udemy course ['JavaScript and React for Developers: Master the Essentials'](https://www.udemy.com/js-and-react-for-devs) where we went over calling an API with the CallBack method and with the new Promises Method. Started the API section in Udacity's FE Nanodegree to align the subjects I was working on. 

**Thoughts:** I'd like to dive a little deeper into the way promises vs callbacks works.

<!--**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.--> 

<!--**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.-->
