# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 01, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Worked a little on the Udacity front-end nanodegree. Started Cassidy William's Udemy course ['JavaScript and React for Developers: Master the Essentials'](https://www.udemy.com/js-and-react-for-devs)

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to try out React. I've worked with Angular before, and I'd like to find out which framework I enjoy more.

### Day 2: January 02, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Started the website optimization project for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree. Worked through most of the events and callbacks section of Cassidy William's Udemy course ['JavaScript and React for Developers: Master the Essentials'](https://www.udemy.com/js-and-react-for-devs). I didn't have enough time to get to the section project. 

**Thoughts:** Wish I had more time to spend on it today. I was taking notes on some of the examples given in the Udemy course, so it took a lot longer. 

### Day 3: January 03, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Finished the assignment from the events and callbacks section of Cassidy William's Udemy course ['JavaScript and React for Developers: Master the Essentials'](https://www.udemy.com/js-and-react-for-devs), which finished out the section. You can find my answer [here](https://github.com/aevrah/theme-toggler). I started the AJAX section. 

**Thoughts:** Already over 20% complete with the course. I think that it is well put together so far. The only issue I've had is with the volume. 

### Day 4: January 04, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Finished the AJAX section of Cassidy William's Udemy course ['JavaScript and React for Developers: Master the Essentials'](https://www.udemy.com/js-and-react-for-devs) where we went over calling an API with the CallBack method and with the new Promises Method. Started the API section in Udacity's FE Nanodegree to align the subjects I was working on. 

**Thoughts:** I'd like to dive a little deeper into the way promises vs callbacks works. 

### Day 5: January 05, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Started section 5 on JSON of Cassidy William's Udemy course ['JavaScript and React for Developers: Master the Essentials'](https://www.udemy.com/js-and-react-for-devs). 

**Thoughts:** I'm going to need a way to code while away from the computer if I'm going to complete this challenge on days I'm out of the house. 

### Day 6: January 06, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Started using the Py app, so that I can code while away from my computer. 

**Thoughts:** I really like having multiple learning methods going at the same time. I feel like it is solidifying the concepts better and faster to me. 

### Day 7: January 07, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Finished section 5 on JSON of Cassidy William's Udemy course ['JavaScript and React for Developers: Master the Essentials'](https://www.udemy.com/js-and-react-for-devs). There was a bug in the final project solution that took me some time to fix. 

**Thoughts:** First week complete of the challenge! I like my progress so far, and the methods I am using to learn. 

### Day 8: January 08, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Finished section 6 on Scope of Cassidy William's Udemy course ['JavaScript and React for Developers: Master the Essentials'](https://www.udemy.com/js-and-react-for-devs). Went through the differences between the call, apply, and bind methods in JavaScript. 

**Thoughts:** I really liked Cassidy's simplified explanations for the differences between these methods.
