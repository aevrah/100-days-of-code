# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 01, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Worked a little on the Udacity front-end nanodegree. Started Cassidy William's Udemy course ['JavaScript and React for Developers: Master the Essentials'] (https://www.udemy.com/js-and-react-for-devs)

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to try out React. I've worked with Angular before, and I'd like to find out which framework I enjoy more.

<!--**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.--> 

<!--**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.-->
